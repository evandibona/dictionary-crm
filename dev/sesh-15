+l is an annoying word. Because of the necessity of handling long strings. 
  #1 I could just use underscores, in_this_manner.
  #2 The separate stack option from before worked well. 
  #3 Or rewrite the main loop into a while statement. 
      So that when '"' is invoked it can hijack the index and
      Add every word until another quotation mark. 
  #4 Rewrite the main loop so that it iterates over individual characters. 

But for now I think that I will just remove this word, 
it's technically redundant right now with '@' and '!'
