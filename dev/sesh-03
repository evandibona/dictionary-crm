The fun part about creating my CRM is I can work my own calendar into this 
system. The 2 weeks of the rising moon can give higher priority to the clouds, 
and to growing my business. The 2 weeks of the waning moon can be devoted to
pruning away the stuff that I don't need and focusing on the gritty parts of
the business. Then on the Sabbaths and festivals I will be able to pull back.

That said, a calendaring system is going to come much later, because that really
will require a whole separate app to import the events that are generated by 
this CRM. 

What do I do with a wishlist?
Highly Visible:
  AKA, every day this is put in my face. OR
  Perhaps more practically, it is available on a certain screen. Easy access. 
  Just like Birthdays.
