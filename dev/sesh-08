Hmm so what is really more important at this time is the CSV aspect to this entire system. Most significantly the ability to import data from a spreadsheet. 


Now that I think about it though the real challenge is that there will be many formats for the CSV imports. For example I may decide to take notes in one session much differently than I will in another several months from now. So really what is most important is the ability to script an import more efficiently.
