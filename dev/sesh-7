Now I really want to step it up to the next level. 
I've run some thought experiments on alternate data schemes and 
nothing is really worth implementing at this point. 
Especially since we have yet to give this current setup a fair shot yet. 

So at this moment the goal is to make this library useful from the 
Lua interpreter. 


db = crm.load-database('data')
