[[[   C -- S -- V   ]]]

So when I'm iterating through a csv it is a very unique structure. Because the first line sets the structure and every subsequent line is its own object, or set of objects. 

In a more pure setup, the first row is used as the key. Subsequent rows are attributed to individual objects with the keys of row #1. 

Process line one, then do every subsequent line. The file handler keeps track of the current line, even though it doesn't give me all the variable I want.


For
  First line, get columns and save as array. 
  line[key['First\ Name']]
