-- The Big To Do --

-- Log Displays
  -- All Notes, All Events

-- User Friendliness --
--   tags used
-- flatten function
-- Difference of sets, aka all trunks that are not tagged by __
  -- Implement as each one that returns arrays, has a positive and neg option.

-- At some point redesign this so that anything pushed to B
--  pops it down into the stack. 

-- next  Array element after the found one. 

-- Pretty Printing needs to all be isolated to a library. 
-- Definitely need an inline way of handling long strings. 
  -- _ has its limits
-- "crm.split()" needs to be changed to misc.split
-- Search by content, not just data. 
-- Create array of content of a specific tag. 
--    note :@:   or   note @:
-- define f as finding the first entry which matches. 
-- Change +b so that it defaults to _ if the stack is empty. 
-- get good at listing employees, aka, branches and their leaves.
-- get good at displaying a company log. Events and Notes with times.
-- make sure Tags, Events, and Notes all have words to manage them.
-- Word for 'nullifying' an entry.
--  Date zeroed, gets ignored on rebuild. 
-- Work on the other 2 uses of the findAll function
-- All of these array operations need their own library
-- Search function needs work so that it can find a specific phone number.  


---
--- TURN PRETTY-PRINT INTO AN ITERATOR IN CRM
---
-- That way it can simplify graph, prettyPrint, and allow
-- for the simple navigation of search results.
