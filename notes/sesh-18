What I really want, more than anything else, but only after we've iterated on the engine and cleaned that up; is to shuffle trees around like a deck of cards. To cleave off a tree into a secondary database, so the one I have on hand is alive, fresh, and easy to understand. Then the older ones can be perused from time to time, either for contacts, or to sell the information.
