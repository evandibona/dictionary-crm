Time To Iterate

It's been awhile, I've got a list of small annoyances, let's fix this. 


New structure:
  /lib/data     DB fx's and Arrays
  /lib/repl     Everything that involves live-shuffling of data 
  /lib/crm      Macros and intelligence specific to business data
  /lib/disp     Text wrap, prettyPrint, date format
  cli.lua       Minimal code needed to define a default cli
  my-cli.lua



Benefits:
  /lib/books    For a personal library that starts to become large. 
  /lib/personal For tracking birthdays, money owed, time spent with who.
