The two priorities are:
  #1 Tags
  #2 Database File Management

But now there are larger picture issues as well. The helper functions that 
I add to make my life easier also polute the simple setup of this program. 

Somehow, someway, the automation I provide for myself must be modular. 

  #1 Is to do it in the command line. 
    ./cli companies.db -helper prospecting.lua

  #2 Rewrite CLI each time. 

  #3 I could implement a more complete forth language and add on with 
     forth files. Maybe even blending the database with the language. 

The first option is my favorite by far. To keep everything clean I think the
external file used, ought to not have any dependencies. It will interact
only with the numbers, strings, and tables passed to it.
