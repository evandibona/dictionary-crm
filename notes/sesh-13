This is clunky. I like aspects of the command language, but it's not good. 


Let's say I want to add someone, his info, and a note. 

company f dorian-gray +b
  "first:Dorian 'Chuck'" +l
  "last:Gray" +l
  "phone:7037234306" +l
  "address:123 Rainbows End" +l
  "city:Pomona" +l "state:NV" +l
  "email:j.gray@company.com" +l

Tweaking the returns of +l helps. But it's still time-consuming to type. 
How can this be improved? And how can it be more intuitive?

company dorian-gray +employee
  "Dorian" first "Gray" last
  "7037234306" phone
  "j.gray@company.com" email
  "123 Rainbows End" address
  "Pomona" city "NV" state

Better, but quotes are still a pain. 

The only solution I can see is a wizard.
