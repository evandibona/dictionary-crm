Another point worth noting is that ideally, nothing is deleted. 

In my original conception at least, a new database is reconstructed from the old, but nothing is deleteable directly. 

Now this does have some serious challenges in allowing the computer to assess what to take and what to keep, selecting what to take, etc. 

For now, having the 'nix' word, is actually very usefull. 
  And clean. 

At the end of the day maintaining simplicity is the most important thing. Keeping the code base small, structure obvious, and usefulness of words high. 

That said, there may be value in mapping out these hierarchies at a higher level to keep track of what's happening, and assigning a few words to deal with the larger structures. 

                        O
            A   B   C   D   E   F   G
           a b   b  |  abc 
          12
          .
          .
          1 2 3 4
         ab
