# Customer Relationship Management

Most CRM's work just fine, but it's the little bits of friction that add up to major frustrations. 

  * Like the 10 clicks it can take to add a new customer. 
  * Even 5 clicks just to log a phone call. 
  * Search functions are often mediocre and have no extensibility. 
  * Database features are usually acceptable, besides formatting
  * The real pain comes with the misuse of these software packages by
    corporate managers. And they force one crappy followup script on
    every single bugger who walks through that office. 

There's really no reason for these uniform rules. Besides a little glitz and glam, this software really belongs in the 80s and maybe 90s. There is no reason to pay that much money for such simple s$17. 

Honestly if you took a Honda dealership and replaced their CRM with an intuitive SQL frontend, you'd see a huge improvement right off the bat. Maybe hire one IT guy who could work one-on-one with each salesman. Craft a few simple scripts to put in their pockets. That matches each of their own styles and/or training.

So yeah, that's pretty much my motivation here. Except programming is not something I do much of. First time even touching LUA, but it's easy enough. The real reasoning behind the dictionary format is its ease of use. Should be simple to implement all kinds of scripts on top of it. And if/when I change platforms, my information can come with me. Even if the tools are rewritten.
