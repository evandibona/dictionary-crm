# Customer Relationship Management

A small set of Lua scripted CRM tools. Currently packaged as an interactive command line interface. 

## Why

Most CRM's work fine, but not great. It's the little bits of friction that add up to major frustrations. 

  * Like the 5 clicks it takes just to make and log a phone call. 
  * The 10 clicks to add a new customer. 
  * Mediocre searches, with extensibility. 
  * No import, which can limit the salesman's ability to cater to his prospect. 
  * The greatest frustrations however, are how CRM's are yet another
    method for a corporation to place its employees into little boxes. 
    In an attempt to create a synthesis of human and mechanical, but
    only creating something which is the worst of both worlds. 

Spending money on these systems as an individual or small company is pointless.
If many salesmen at dealerships (for example) had a viable alternative, 
they would drop their own CRM in a second. 

So that's the bulk of my motivation here. Except programming is not something I do much of. Which is why my sales job had to end for me to have the time and patience to build this. 

## What

At its core this is a linked list, stored in a binary file. Reminiscent of Forth. That's it. In practice I hope that it will expand to multiple frontends, export/import abilities, and search tools. 

## When 
## Who

In the short term this is for people like myself. For whom a simple interface is preferred, text-based is desirable, and the ability to script additions is desirable. 

## Lofty Ambitions
* Binary files packaged into the database file: jpg/png, mp3, txt
* Multiple tracks for different customer types. 
  * So that the big picture plan can be coded.
* Calendar system
