# Customer Relationship Management

## Why

Most CRM's work fine, but not great. It's the little bits of friction that add up to major frustrations. 

  * Like the 5 clicks it takes just to make and log a phone call. 
  * The 10 clicks to add a new customer. 
  * Mediocre searches, with extensibility. 
  * No import, which can limit the salesman's ability to cater to his prospect. 
  * The greatest frustrations however, are how CRM's are yet another
    method for a corporation to place its employees into little boxes. 
    In an attempt to create a synthesis of human and mechanical, but
    only creating something which is the worst of both worlds. 

So spending money on these systems as an individual or small company is pointless.
And if many salesmen at dealerships (for example) had an alternative, 
they would drop their own CRM in a second. Or most likely, use them in parallel. 

So that's the bulk of my motivation here. Except programming is not something I do much of. Which is why my sales job had to end for me to have the time and patience to build this. 

## What

At its core this is a linked list, stored in a binary file. Reminiscent of Forth. That's it. In practice I hope that it will expand to multiple frontends, export/import abilities, and search tools. 

## When 
## Who

As mentioned above, this is targeted to already overloaded salesmen who just need something that works and doesn't try to do their job for them. 

Something that can be repurposed for both short term and long term projects. Have a fundraiser you're organizing in your spare time? Great! Import your contacts from excel and get started!
